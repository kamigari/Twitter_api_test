# Twitter_api_test
Practice with the twitter API

## Getting Started

The twitter_api_prueba.py is a practice script for getting the languajes from the tweets sought in it.

### Prerequisities

To run this script you will need python3, and the following librarires:

* twitter
* json
* pylab
* numpy

To install this libraries I recommend using the python package manager PIP, an example would be:

```
pip install numpy
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

You just have to follow the steps given by console, introduce always integers.
Introduzca un hashgtag para buscar en twitter = Introduce a hashtag to seek on twitter.
```
Introduzca un hashgtag para buscar en twitter:
#
```

### Simple example of the default test

This is a simple example on how to use the script. Being all the values positive and integers, you can change all the iterations numbers. The key space is recommendable to be 128, any higher will not increase the security. 

```
